Hi, I'm Ravi — Welcome to the Verse of Coding! 😊

**Code-Like-a-Pro**, a practical guide and codebase to help Python developers master **industry-level programming standards** as used by top tech companies.

This repository walks you through 14 essential pillars of professional software development in Python, including real-world examples, reusable templates, and best practices for production-ready code.

---

## Topics Covered ✔

### 1. ✅ Code Quality & Readability
- PEP8 standards, meaningful naming, modular functions
- Commenting the "why", not the "what"
- Examples of clean vs messy code

### 2. 🧪 Testing and Testability
- Unit testing with `pytest`
- Test-driven development (TDD) structure
- Mocking and edge-case testing

### 3. ⚠️ Error Handling
- `try-except-else-finally` pattern
- Custom exceptions
- Centralized exception handling strategies

### 4. 📋 Logging and Debugging
- Using `logging` instead of `print()`
- Logging levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
- Avoiding sensitive data in logs
- Real-time debugging with logs

### 5. 📦 Modularity and Reusability
- Structuring a maintainable codebase
- Reusable components and utility functions
- Separation of concerns

### 6. 🧰 Tooling and Automation
- Code formatters: `black`, `isort`
- Linters: `flake8`, `pylint`
- Automation using `Makefile` or `pre-commit` hooks

### 7. 🔁 Performance Optimization
- Choosing the right data structures
- Using generators, caching, and lazy evaluation
- Profiling with `cProfile`, `line_profiler`

### 8. 🧪 Type Safety and Static Analysis
- Type hints and annotations
- Checking with `mypy`, `pyright`
- Using `TypedDict`, `dataclass`

### 9. 🔐 Security Best Practices
- Avoiding hardcoded secrets
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure API and file handling

### 10. 📄 Documentation
- Writing docstrings (Google/NumPy style)
- README + API documentation
- Tools like `Sphinx`, `pdoc`

### 11. 🔄 CI/CD and Automation
- GitHub Actions setup for testing/linting/deployment
- Automated test runs and code formatting checks

### 12. 📦 Dependency Management
- Using `venv`, `pipenv`, `poetry`
- Locking with `requirements.txt`
- Updating and auditing packages

### 13. 🔃 Version Control (Git)
- Branching strategies
- Clean commit history
- Pull request standards

### 14. 🏗️ Scalable & Maintainable Architecture
- Clean Architecture, Layered Design
- Project templates for services or APIs
- Logging + Testing integrated architecture

Along with the core principles, I’ve also added **multiple hands-on mini-projects** to give you a visual and practical understanding of how these topics work in the real world.
Each project is designed to be:
- Easy to understand
- Modular and extensible
- Focused on industry best practices
